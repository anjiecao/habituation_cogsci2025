Habituation and dishabituation are fundamental processes in learning and cognition. Habituation refers to the decrease in response to a repeated stimulus, while dishabituation describes the renewed increase in response following the introduction of a novel stimulus. These processes are essential for learning from experience and have been widely documented across a broad range of species [@rankin2009habituation; @thompson2009habituation]. From single-cell organisms [e.g., @boisseau2016habituation; @ginsburg2009epigenetic; @dussutour2021learning] to humans [e.g. @colombo2009infant; @jeffrey1971habituation; @sokolov1990orienting;], habituation and dishabituation enable individuals to filter out repetitive, non-informative stimuli while remaining sensitive to novel or meaningful changes. These mechanisms have become a cornerstone of research methods in cognitive development [@cohen2004uses; @kucharsky2024habituation; @aslin2007s; @oakes2010using]. 

A typical infant study utilizing the habituation paradigm involves repeatedly presenting an infant with the same stimulus until they exhibit a decline in interest, often measured by a progressive decrease in looking time. Once habituation is established (e.g., looking time in the final trials must drop to 50% of initial looking), the infant is presented with two stimuli: one familiar (previously shown) and one novel. A dishabituation response—indicated by significantly longer looking time at the novel stimulus—suggests that the infant can discriminate between the two. Dishabituation magnitude serves as a crucial index of attentional recovery and sensitivity to novel stimuli. As a result, this method – inducing habituation response and testing dishabituation –  has been extensively used to investigate infants' perceptual and cognitive development, providing valuable insights into early learning mechanisms.

How do individual differences in habituation and dishabituation reflect underlying cognitive mechanisms and developmental change? Extensive research has explored their variability and predictive value for later cognitive development. In general, findings suggest that the rate of habituation—how quickly an infant’s attention declines in response to repeated exposure to a stimulus—is associated with foundational cognitive processes such as information processing speed [@poli2024individual; @hunter1988multifactor]. Infants who habituate more quickly tend to show higher IQ scores, better language acquisition, and stronger executive function abilities in later childhood [@kavvsek2004predicting; @slater1997can; @colombo2004developmental]. Similarly, individual differences in dishabituation—the extent to which an infant's attention recovers when presented with a novel stimulus—are often interpreted as indicators of memory strength. Greater dishabituation responses have been associated with stronger recognition memory [@fagan1983infant; @fagan1984relationship]. These results highlight the importance of individual variability in early attentional processes. Measures of habituation and dishabituation can serve as early cognitive markers with long-term implications. 

Prior work also underscores how factors such as age and stimulus complexity shape habituation and dishabituation [@hunter1988multifactor; @colombo2004developmental]. According to the influential @hunter1988multifactor model, the more an infant has been exposed to a stimulus, the less novel information remains to be processed, leading to a decline in attention. However, the more complex a stimulus is, the greater the amount of information available to be learned, leading to prolonged engagement. Additionally, older infants are assumed to process information more efficiently than younger infants, allowing them to habituate more quickly. This framework provides a valuable qualitative account of how developmental and stimulus-related factors interact to shape attentional dynamics. Nevertheless, its predictions remain largely qualitative rather than quantitative and have not been systematically tested [cf. @bergmann2016development; @hunter1983development; @kosie2024manybabies].

Understanding how individual differences in habituation and dishabituation interact with these factors is crucial for developing a comprehensive model of early learning. Individuals who habituate more quickly may process information more efficiently, allowing them to detect and respond to novel stimuli more effectively, resulting in greater dishabituation. Alternatively, faster habituation could reflect a general tendency to disengage from visual stimuli more rapidly, leading to weaker attentional recovery when a new stimulus appears. Another important factor that may influence dishabituation is volatility—the degree of variability in looking time across habituation trials. Behavioral variability has often been interpreted as random noise [@faisal2008noise; @renart2014variability] or a lack of control [@todorov2004optimality]. However, variability can also be adaptive, reflecting sensitivity to environmental contingencies and dynamic attention regulation [@aston2005integrative; @wu2014temporal]. In the context of habituation and dishabituation, higher volatility in looking time may indicate greater flexibility in attention allocation, potentially enhancing dishabituation by allowing infants to remain more responsive to novel stimuli.

Systematically studying these relationships—especially across different age groups and stimulus contexts—remains challenging. Recruiting and testing large infant samples can be highly resource-intensive [@oakes2017sample; @debolt2020robust], making it difficult to capture sufficient variability. Additionally, habituation outcomes can be influenced by measurement noise and fixed threshold criteria [@kucharsky2024habituation; @dannemiller1984infant; @thomas2004habituation], which risk misclassifying infants’ true levels of attention. As a result, genuine variability in cognitive processing may be obscured by methodological artifacts. To overcome these limitations and capture more reliable estimates of individual differences, researchers have increasingly adopted large-scale data approaches such as meta-analysis and mega-analysis [@koile2021toward; @bergmann2018promoting], as well as online studies, which facilitate the recruitment of large and diverse participant samples [@chuey2021moderated; @sheskin2020online; @chuey2024conducting]. 

In this study, we use large-scale datasets from online studies and mega-analysis to explore how individual differences in habituation rate predict dishabituation magnitude.  Unlike previous work focused solely on infancy [@gilmore2002examining; @vsimkovic2021additive; cf  @cao2023habituation; @Raz_2025], here we take a lifespan approach, examining habituation and dishabituation from infancy to adulthood. In addition, we also explored how dishabituation was shaped by factors like habituation volatility (e.g., fluctuations in looking time), age, and stimulus complexity shape dishabituation. By comparing across three age groups, we provide new insights into developmental continuity and discontinuity. To preview our findings, we found (1) Individuals who habituate faster show a stronger rebound in attention to novel stimuli;  (2) In adults, but not younger participants, greater variability in looking time during habituation is associated with stronger dishabituation, and (3) Different operationalizations of dishabituation yield somewhat divergent results.
