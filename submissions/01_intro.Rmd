Habituation and dishabituation are fundamental processes in learning and cognition. Habituation refers to the decrease in response to a repeated stimulus, while dishabituation describes the renewed increase in response following the introduction of a novel stimulus. These processes are essential for learning from experience and have been widely documented across a broad range of species [@rankin2009habituation; @thompson2009habituation]. From single-cell organisms [e.g., @boisseau2016habituation; @ginsburg2009epigenetic; @dussutour2021learning] to humans [e.g. @colombo2009infant; @jeffrey1971habituation; @sokolov1990orienting;], habituation and dishabituation enable individuals to filter out repetitive, non-informative stimuli while remaining sensitive to novel or meaningful changes. 
These mechanisms have become a cornerstone of research methods in cognitive development [@cohen2004uses; @kucharsky2024habituation; @aslin2007s; @oakes2010using].  A typical infant study utilizing the habituation paradigm involves repeatedly presenting an infant with the same stimulus until they exhibit a decline in interest, often measured by a progressive decrease in looking time. Once habituation is established (e.g., looking time in the final trials must drop to 50% of initial looking), the infant is presented with two stimuli: one familiar (previously shown) and one novel. A dishabituation response—indicated by significantly longer looking time at the novel stimulus—suggests that the infant can discriminate between the two. Dishabituation magnitude  serves as a crucial index of attentional recovery and sensitivity to novel stimuli. In this work, we used existing data collected using this method to study individual differences in dishabituation, and what individual-level predictors (e.g. habituation rate and age) and experiment-level predictors (e.g. stimulus complexity) account for those differences. 

### Endogenous and exogenous factors driving looking behavior

Understanding how endogenous and exogenous factors-- differences between individuals and differences between tasks-- interact to guide looking behavior is crucial for developing a comprehensive model of early learning. In one influential model of habituation [@hunter1988multifactor], learners, including infant learners, engage with stimuli to optimize learning. This leads to the predictions that (i) more efficient learners (e.g. older infants) should habituate faster than less efficient learners (e.g. younger infants), (ii) learners should recover attention to novel stimuli as they become more habituated with familiar stimuli, and (iii) learners should engage with a stimulus relative to its information value. All of these predictions have enjoyed empirical support [@cao2023habituation; @Raz_2025; @kidd2012goldilocks]. Particularly striking are studies of individual differences, suggesting that some differences could serve cognitive markers with long-term implications. Habituation rate—how quickly an infant’s attention declines in response to repeated exposure to a stimulus—has been associated with foundational cognitive processes such as information processing speed [@poli2024individual; @hunter1988multifactor]. Infants who habituate more quickly tend to show higher IQ scores, better language acquisition, and stronger executive function abilities in later childhood [@kavvsek2004predicting; @slater1997can; @colombo2004developmental]. Similarly, individual differences in dishabituation—the extent to which an infant's attention recovers when presented with a novel stimulus—have been associated with stronger recognition memory [@fagan1983infant; @fagan1984relationship]. 

Another striking example comes from studies manipulating environmental volatility, or the predictability of upcoming stimuli.  @poli2024individual demonstrated that infant learners adjust their looking behavior in response to volatility: they initiate saccades more quickly when stimuli are highly unpredictable. Yet, we know less about whether volatility varies as a function of the learners, as well as the learning context. On the one hand, behavioral variability has often been interpreted as random noise [@faisal2008noise; @renart2014variability] or a lack of control [@todorov2004optimality]. In the context of habituation and dishabituation, these accounts would predict that greater behavioral volatility during habituation would be unrelated to subsequent dishabituation, or predict weaker dishabituation. On the other hand, behavioral volatility could also be adaptive, reflecting an enhanced sensitivity to potential environmental contingencies and more dynamic attention regulation [@aston2005integrative; @wu2014temporal]. In the context of habituation and dishabituation, higher volatility in looking time may indicate greater flexibility in attention allocation, potentially leading to greater dishabituation by allowing learners to remain more responsive to novel stimuli.

### The challenge of studying drivers of looking behavior

Systematically studying  how different endogenous and exogenous factors shape looking time in the habituation paradigm—especially across different age groups and stimulus contexts—remains challenging. Recruiting and testing large infant samples can be highly resource-intensive [@oakes2017sample; @debolt2020robust], making it difficult to capture sufficient variability. Additionally, habituation outcomes can be influenced by measurement noise and fixed threshold criteria [@kucharsky2024habituation; @dannemiller1984infant; @thomas2004habituation], which risk misclassifying infants’ true levels of attention. As a result, genuine variability in cognitive processing may be obscured by methodological artifacts. To overcome these limitations and capture more reliable estimates of individual differences, researchers have increasingly adopted large-scale data approaches such as meta-analysis and mega-analysis [@koile2021toward; @bergmann2018promoting], as well as online studies, which facilitate the recruitment of large and diverse participant samples [@chuey2021moderated; @sheskin2020online; @chuey2024conducting]. 

Here, we use large-scale datasets from online studies and mega-analysis to explore how individual differences in habituation rate predict dishabituation magnitude.  Unlike previous work focused solely on infancy [@gilmore2002examining; @vsimkovic2021additive; cf  @cao2023habituation; @Raz_2025], here we take a lifespan approach, examining habituation and dishabituation from infancy to adulthood. In addition, we also explored how dishabituation was shaped by factors like habituation volatility (e.g., fluctuations in looking time), age, and stimulus complexity shape dishabituation. By comparing across three age groups, we provide new insights into developmental continuity and discontinuity. To preview our findings, we found (1) Individuals who habituate faster show a stronger rebound in attention to novel stimuli;  (2) In adults, but not younger participants, greater variability in looking time during habituation is associated with stronger dishabituation, and (3) Different operationalizations of dishabituation yield somewhat divergent results.
