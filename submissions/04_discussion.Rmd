From birth, humans explore and learn about the world through our looking behaviors, displaying two canonical behaviors: (1) habituation to repeated stimuli, and (2) recovery of attention to novel stimuli. How do these behaviors vary across individuals, and what predicts them? Studying these questions are challenging because of limitations on measurement precision, and sample size, particularly in infants and young children. In this work, we leveraged three existing habituation datasets—from infancy to adulthood—to investigate relationships between individual differences in participant behaviors (habituation and dishabituation), demographics (age), and task factors (stimulus complexity). In particular, we studied the predictors of dishabituation, or orienting to novel stimuli. Overall, we found that individuals who habituate faster show a stronger rebound in attention to novel stimuli. We also observed that adults who demonstrated more volatile looking during habituation dishabituated more strongly. This work supports longstanding claims that habituation and dishabituation are not merely passive responses governed primarily by the dynamics and features of sensory inputs, but also by the endogenous properties of the observer [@raz2020learning; @koster2020making]. Below, we discuss each of our positive primary findings and their implications for developmental research, and then discuss the discrepancies between the results from our primary and secondary analyses.

Why do infants and adults who habituate more quickly also dishabituate more to novel stimuli? One possible explanation for this relationship is that individuals who habituate more quickly may process information more efficiently, allowing them to disengage from familiar stimuli and reallocate attention to novel ones more readily. Previous studies have shown that habituation and dishabituation reflect rational information gathering, where individuals allocate attention based on the trade-off between extracting useful information from a stimulus and the opportunity to explore new stimuli [@cao2023habituation; @Raz_2025; @karni2025rational]. Under this framework, a steeper decay rate may indicate faster evidence accumulation, allowing individuals to determine more quickly when a stimulus is no longer informative and shift attention to novel inputs. This relationship also raises an intriguing reinterpretation of prior findings on individual differences. While substantial research has identified habituation and dishabituation as distinct measures predictive of later cognitive development,  our findings suggest these measures may, at least in part, reflect a common underlying process. Specifically, the connection between fast habituation and strong dishabituation could imply that both are noisy measures of the same unifactorial construct, such as overall efficiency in processing and attention allocation. If so, this might explain why earlier studies have found overlapping correlations with cognitive outcomes—what appeared to be separate predictors could instead reflect different facets of the same mechanism. Measuring and studying a variety of partially related constructs in the same, large datasets, makes it possible for us to discover the latent, unifying processes that underlie what appear to be separate measures. 

Why do adults with more variable looking during habituation dishabituate more strongly than adults with more consistent looking?  Prior work has investigated the relationship between environmental volatility (i.e. the unpredictability of the stimuli) and looking behaviors on a group level; for example, Poli et al showed that infants were faster to saccade to visual stimuli when the stream of stimuli they watched was unpredictable, than when it was predictable. Here, we found that internal behavioral volatility also predicts looking behavior. Together these findings suggest that observers can adapt to environmental instability, and that observers can also meaningfully vary in how unstable their looking behaviors are, even for repeated stimuli. In the current work, adults whose attention fluctuates more during habituation, are not necessarily inattentive or randomly shifting their gaze; rather, they may be more attuned to potential changes and better prepared to respond when those changes occur. This interpretation aligns with models of adaptive attention, where variability in gaze patterns reflects an active strategy to monitor the environment for new information [@aston2005integrative; @wu2014temporal]. However, we only observed this relationship in adults. This might be due to younger participants exhibiting (truly) noisier looking behaviors, making it harder to detect systematic relationships between volatility and dishabituation. 

Our current results and interpretations are constrained by several limitations. First, the heterogeneity of our data sources may weaken our developmental conclusions. While the adult and preschooler datasets share a comparable paradigm, the preschooler dataset was very small, and the infant dataset integrates studies with diverse stimuli and procedures, introducing additional noise that complicates direct comparisons across datasets. For example, it is unclear whether the way we operationalized stimulus complexity truly captures the same contrast across adults, who watched stimuli of animate agents that were more vs less complex, and infants, who watched stimuli of including vs excluding animate agents.

Discrepancies between our primary and secondary results highlight that individual differences in looking behavior depend on the measure of dishabituation used. In both the adult and preschooler datasets, no predictor was consistently robust, and neither group showed significant dishabituation across measures (ps > 0.05), contrasting with previous studies that found significant effects using a different operationalization of dishabituation [@cao2023habituation; @raz2023no]. In contrast, infant results remained stable: infants generally dishabituated, with steeper habituation rates, simpler stimuli (inanimate objects), and younger age predicting greater novelty recovery. However, the relationship between initial looking time and dishabituation varied by method, with residual-based estimates being positive and log-transformed estimates negative. Given that many developmental studies choose just a single measure for their dependent variable, our findings serve as a cautionary note that different operationalizations can shape observed effects and researchers should consider robustness checks for exploratory analyses of developmental data.

A last limitation is that while we found individual-level predictors of dishabituation, it is unknown whether these predictors reflect person-level individual differences, state-level individual differences, or a combination of both. Measures such as volatility, decay rate, and dishabituation magnitude may not be stable over time, and indeed display low test-retest reliability [@cristia2016test; @hood1996habituation; @colombo1987stability]. The most conservative claim way to interpret our results is that participants who vary in behavior across a short span of time—whether due to intrinsic person-level traits, momentary state-level fluctuations, or an interaction between the two—demonstrate a stronger dishabituation effect. For future research, formal computational modeling could provide a more systematic understanding of how different operationalizations influence observed effects, clarifying the extent to which methodological choices are sensitive to noise and error. By modeling different sources of noise—such as individual fluctuations in attention, measurement error, and trial-level variability—this approach could help determine the conditions under which we should expect robust results vs those that are more sensitive to operationalization decisions, or state-level shifts in participant state. 

By analyzing large-scale datasets that span infancy to adulthood, we demonstrated that individual differences in habituation trajectories predict dishabituation magnitude. Although methodological heterogeneity and smaller sample sizes in preschoolers limit our ability to make direct developmental comparisons, this work provides a strong basis for future research to understand the developmental changes of visual attention. Moreover, our findings highlight that fluctuations in looking behavior should not be simply dismissed as noise; rather, they could also reflect adaptive strategies that facilitate information gathering. Taken together, these insights underscore the need to view visual attention as an active process that contributes to learning across development.
